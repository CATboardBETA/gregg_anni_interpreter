# Gregg Anniversary Edition Interpreter

# Special setup

This requires an installation of `libtorch` to work.  The `libtorch` library
is not included in this repository.  You can download it from the
[PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), e.g, for macOS:
```shell
wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-macos-1.13.1.zip
unzip libtorch-macos-1.13.1.zip
```
